    <h2>DOWEL ANCHORING / ANCHOR INSTALLATION</h2>
    <p>Dowel Anchoring & Anchor Installation has become an everyday occurrence of the building construction & industries as well. It may raise initial construction cost but this procedure has been proven to be a secure and safer procedure over the long period of time. Both the two procedures are reliable and are used for different applications.</p>	
    
	<p>The invention relates to fixing threaded anchor rods & dowels in concrete, rock and the like. Typically, for producing anchored rod/dowels in concrete surface, a bore hole is made epoxy insert into the hole with dispensing gun & static mixture as per manufacturer's standards and then fix the required anchor/dowel.</p>
	
	<p>The objective of the invention is to increase the bearing capacity and safety level of such anchors/dowel, another advantage in chemical anchoring to achieve maximum strength with shorter depth.</p>

  <section id="diamondcorecutting">
    <h2>DIAMOND CORE CUTTING</h2>
    <p>Diamond Core Cutting system is performed by using rotary core cutting machine with a diamond core bit attached in order to create precisely measures holes. Diamond is one of the hardest naturally occurring material in the world, it is ideal for creating openings in a Concrete. Diamond Core Cutting is a precision instrument, creating clean, accurate holes with diameters of between 8mm to more than 1500mm along with depth of 4000mm.</p>
    <p>It is a non-percussive technique; therefore structural integrity is maintained during this operation. This method runs water through the driving shaft to ensure that the workspace remains free of dust. It can be operated in either a vertical or horizontal direction depending on the requirements.</p>
    <p>Diamond Core Cutting is a cost-effective cutting technique that decreases both time to project completion and labor costs. Other advantages include:</p>
	<li>No-to-low noise pollution</li>
	<li>No vibration means no damage to nearby structures</li>
	<li>An environmentally-friendly, debris-free system</li>
	<li>Cost-effective</li>

  <section id="waterproofing">
    <h2>WATER PROOFING</h2>
    <p>In building construction, waterproong is a fundamental aspect of creating a building envelope, which is acontrolled environment. The roof covering materials, siding, foundations, and all of the various penetrationsthrough these surfaces must be water-resistant as well as waterproof.</p>
    <p>Following are the major types of Waterproofing Systems:</p>
	<li>Cementitious/Crestline Waterproofing</li>
	<li>Liquid Waterproofing Membrane</li>
	<li>Bituminous Waterproofing</li>
	<li>Acrylic Waterproofing System</li>
	<li>Elastomeric Coating System</li>
	<li>Bituminous Membrane Waterproofing Method</li>
	<li>Polyurethane Resin Waterproofing Injection System</li>
	<p>A leaky ceiling or wet basement is harmful for RCC Structure. It can lead to structural damages. Dampness will also attract wood rot and termites. Water proofing methods are used to prevent water entering into various sections of building structures like tanks, roof, walls and floor or expansion joints.</p>

    <h2>PROTECTIVE COATINGS</h2>
    <p>It has been a long-term felt necessity of chemical, textile & pharmaceutical industries, such a coating compound that can offer a promising protection to their plant ooring against intense corrosive & etching caused by various acids, alkalis and such other corrosive chemicals of organic & inorganic origin. To meet this crucial demands of chemical industries.</p>
    <p>Reinforced concrete is a composite material. Its structural performance is realized only when concrete and steel act in unison during the service life of the structure. The compressive and tensile loads are carried by concrete and steel respectively. Steel protects concrete from cracking under tensile loads and concrete protects steel from corrosion by providing an alkaline environment around it. So long as this happens, the reinforced concrete structures perform satisfactorily. Even though the concrete can be a very strong material, it is also subject to deterioration. Concrete can be porous so that chemicals can penetrate the pores and attack the paste.</p>
	<p>The paste and aggregate can also be worn down by physical impact and abrasion. Water can penetrate concrete, freeze and expand inside it when the temperature drops, and ultimately weaken the concrete from within. In addition, if the concrete has reinforcing steel bar (rebar) to impart additional strength and other properties, the rebar can corrode if moisture, oxygen and chloride ions penetrate the concrete. Corrosion or rebar contributes to the deterioration of concrete.</p>
	<p>Various external hostile environmental substances, such as, water, carbon dioxide, oxygen, chlorides, sulfides and biological organisms are transported from the atmosphere into the concrete and attack steel and concrete in different mechanisms causing premature deterioration of reinforced concrete, challenging its durability and resulting in premature failure of the structures. The entry of the harmful agents can be restricted and or avoided by providing the barrier surface coatings on the concrete. Thus conservation of structural integrity can be achieved during service life.</p>

  <section id="nonshrinkgrouting">
    <h2>NON-SHRINK GROUTING</h2>
    <p>Grout is a viscous material that is used to fill the space between two elements for bonding them or to create a water-tight sealing existing structures. Grouts are used in a variety of applications such as repair of cracks, water–stopping in submerged structures such as canals, tunnels, etc., fill seams between tiles, and for stabilizing soil. Here we have briefed about types of grouts used in the repair of cracks. Grout is distinguished by its low viscosity and lack of lime (added to mortar for pliability), additionally, grout is thin so it flows readily into gaps. Grout varieties include tiling grout, ooring grout, resin grout, non-shrink grout, structural grout and thixotropic grout.</p>
  </section>
  
  <section id="cementitiousgrouting">
    <h2>CEMENTITIOUS GROUTING</h2>
    <p>The mixing of Grout with water produces a uid suspension which can be poured under base plates or into foundation pockets. Setting and hardening are the important processes which affect the performance of cement grout. Moreover, presence of excessive voids would also affect the strength, stiffness & permeability of grout. It is versatile in application of lling voids and gaps in structures.</p>
  </section>
  
  <section id="cementitiousgrouting">
    <h2>EPOXY GROUTING</h2>
    <p>Epoxy grout consists of epoxy resin, epoxy hardener and Fillers/aggregates. In fact, there are various types of resin used in construction industry like epoxy, polyester, polyurethane etc. Though epoxy grout appears to imply the presence of cement material by its name, it does not contain any cement at all. On the other hand, epoxy hardener serves to initiate the hardening process of epoxy grout. It is commonly used for repairing hairline cracks and cavities in concrete structures and can be adopted as primer or bonding agent.</p>
  </section>
  
  <section id="crackinjection">
    <h2>CRACK INJECTION</h2>
    <p>This method can be used to repair cracks in foundations, basements, beams, columns, slabs, walls and other concrete structures as narrow as 0.5 mm up to 10 mm.</p>
    <p>The method generally consists of drilling holes at close intervals along the cracks, installing entry ports, and injecting the epoxy under pressure.</p>
    <p>Epoxy injection has been successfully used in the repair of cracks in buildings, bridges, dams, foundations and other types of concrete structures. If the crack is active and it is desired to seal it while allowing continued movement at that location, a Polysulfide /Polyurethane sealant shall be used that allows the crack to function as a joint.</p>

  <section id="stitchcorecutting">
    <h2>STITCH CORE CUTTING</h2>
    <p>Stitch core Cutting system is used to form slots and opening through wall and floor where others methods of cutting are not practical or accessible. This method is predominantly used in restricted areas. Stitching is also used extensively in areas with close proximity to “clean or controlled” environments as this method brings the benefit of significantly reduced cutting are far easier to control & contain </p>
    <p>Stitch Core Cutting is a common technique used to make non-standard shaped and sized holes, when standard cutting equipment isn't suited for the job. This technique is performed by coring a series of overlapping holes, allowing for one large segment to be removed. Stitch drilling is often the answer when dealing with relatively thick slabs or walls, or when the structural integrity of the purposed opening cannot be compromised.</p>
